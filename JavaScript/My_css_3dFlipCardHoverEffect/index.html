						<p>The report strictly adheres to 
						the principles of independence, 
						impartiality and objectivity. 
						It sought consent from sources 
						on the use of information, 
						ensuring confidentiality as appropriate. 
						Specific attention was paid to 
						the protection of victims and witnesses,
						considering their well-founded fear of 
						reprisals. For their security, 
						the Uyghur Research Institute has changed
						the name of the interviewee 
						unless there is consent to use 
						their real name.</p>

						<p>Despite the Chinese government's claimthatrapid
						economic and social development has created

						troubled relationship with the Chinese Communist Partyâ€™s 
						central government authorities and have been 
						facing a Beijing-supported influx of Chinese 
						migrants into their homeland.</p>
